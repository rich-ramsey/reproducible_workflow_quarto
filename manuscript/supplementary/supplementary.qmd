```{r}

library(tinytable)
```

# Model formulas #

The regression formula for the full model (model b2):
$$rt \sim 1 + stimulus * compatibility + \ 
(1 + stimulus * compatibility | pid)$$

*Note:* rt = reaction time (ms); stimulus = blah; compatibility = blah; pid = subject/participant identifier.


# A supplementary table #

Here, I just reproduce the table from the main manuscript to save time making anything else.
But of course in a real paper, you wouldn't do this, you'd just show whatever you needed.
It is labelled differently to reflect that it is a supplementary table (Table S1).

```{r}
#| include: false

fix_tab <- read_csv("../../exp1/tables/b2_fix_tab.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example-s1
#| tbl-cap: Supplementary table created with `tinytable::tt()`
#| echo: false

tinytable::tt(
  head(fix_tab, 2),
  digits = 2,
  notes = "Note. This is a footnote."
)
```

# A supplementary figure #

Let's take a look at the mixing of chains in the model.
This is a useful model diagnostic check to see that the model built ok (Figure S1).

```{r}
#| label: fig-supp-plot
#| fig-cap: Caterpillar plots showing the mixing of chains across parameters in model b2.
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 7
#| echo: false
